'''
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 
 (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. 
 For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

# creates a list of all numbers between 1 and the user's number + 1

divisors = []

# iterate through all the numbers in x list
# if any numbers that equal 0 if modulo i
# append that number to new list

    if num % i == 0:
        divisors.append(i)
